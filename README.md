# Vector_Of_Objects
This program defines a "Merch" class and a "Supplier" class for representing an item of merchandise in a retail store. 
The class definitions are in .h files, and the main driver and method implementations are in .cpp files. The main declares an 
empty vector of Merch objects, and passes the objects by reference to a method that hardcodes attributes for the Merch and 
Supplier classes.
